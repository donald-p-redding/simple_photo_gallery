<h1>Simple Photo Gallery ðŸ“·</h1>

<h2> About: </h2>
<p>This was a simple photo gallery project I worked on during the Core Curriculm at <a href='https://launchschool.com'>Launch School</a>.</p>
<p>The project was designed to test a student's ability to interact with a simple API and update the UI asynchronously</p>
<p>The focus of the project was on updating the UI and making AJAX requests. There is no DB in this project. All changes/ updates made while running the demo will be lost once the app is closed</p>
